I\u0027m going to try and make the appropriate edits to project.clj to achieve the effect shown here, and will push up a subsequent PR intended to replace this one, if that\u0027s okay.  Alternatively, let me know if it\u0027s possible to update someone else\u0027s PR - I don\u0027t think it is.\n\n(TLDR; -1, but with the hope that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.)",
